# hi! i'm laura

## i like to build cool stuff

i‚Äôm a brazilian studying computer science, design, and —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π at northwestern university. despite my silly approach to showing off my work, i‚Äôm a disciplined and passionate person, who wants to create technology that makes change ‚Äì or at least that makes people say ‚Äúwoah that‚Äôs cool‚Äù.

last summer, i got to intern at duolingo and build a language learning app that teaches through music. my team of four shipped a karaoke experience that helps users practice listening skills, and it was especially awesome because i got to bring exposure to my culture by including portuguese. 

currently, i‚Äôm running women in computing at northwestern, building a test-generation tool in the MU Collective Lab, and coding on the side whenever a random idea tickles my fancy. outside of work, i‚Äôm raising my son (a gray cat named loki who bites), cooking bad food for my girlfriend, and playing ps5 games like high on life (doom was too scary).
